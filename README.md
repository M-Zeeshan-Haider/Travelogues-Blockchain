The complete journey
Travelers are moving away from traditional modes of travel planning to digital channels. Delivering a superior online experience is thus imperative for customer retention and to capture a bigger slice of the market. While many travel companies offer an online portal, but the automation has failed to deliver a complete platform for the travelers.
	Tourist use multiple applications, websites to socialize and to share their travel experiences. Users are always concern with the privacy of their data. Many applications have cross platform problems. People tends to use integrated signups which is a common need, video uploading isnâ€™t available in many applications. Private diary is a travellers need to write his travel experiences and stories, and peoples do not have an option to share their past experiences.
